            <h2>Welcome to the Heavy Ions Physics and Electromagnetic Calorimeter Operations in CMS</h2>
            <p>This is a project hosted by the Brazilian Center for Physics Research (CBPF) and supported by FAPERJ E-26/2021JPS-E_40/2021.</p>
            <p align="justify">In this proposal we present the plans for the nucleation of a new line of research and work to be developed at the Brazilian Center for Physical Research - CBPF in Rio de Janeiro. This new nucleus will work in heavy ion physics and in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), one of the LHC experiments at CERN. In Heavy Ion Physics, with a very broad approach, we propose two experimental analyses not yet studied in the group of heavy ions of the CMS, and two phenomenology analyses related to new physics in photon-induced processes from heavy ion beam, as well as human resources formation contributing to the future of science in Brazil. In addition, in another innovative proposal aimed at the operation of the CMS detector, we present the possibility of work in the ECAL with developments in its trigger system as well as verifying the performance of the detector through its monitoring and calibration, during the new period of data taking of the LHC (RunIII) that starts in 2022. This project encompasses cutting-edge themes, fully covered in contemporary physics with the advent of more powerful accelerators, scientifically relevant within the community of High Energy Physics (HEP), of excellent quality, with innovative methodologies, and do not have groups of action in ICTs in Rio de Janeiro. We aim to open new and important research fronts in the institution, with multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary characteristics in research, teaching and extension. Many advances in the frontier of knowledge in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions will be achieved in the next periods of data taking from the LHC, in addition to the prospects of operation of future accelerators, which corroborates our thesis that this is an outstanding and very internationally competitive project. We emphasize the importance of support to the project by FAPERJ, raising the CBPF as one of excellence centers in Heavy Ion Physics and operation of the CMS ECAL in Rio de Janeiro. </p>
