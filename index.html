      <h2>Welcome to the Heavy Ions Physics and Electromagnetic Calorimeter Operations in CMS</h2>
      <p>This project is hosted by the Brazilian Center for Physics Research (CBPF) since 2022 and supported by FAPERJ E-26/2021JPS-E_40/2021.</p>
      <p>
        We present a plan for establishing a new research nucleus at CBPF in Rio de Janeiro, focusing on heavy ion physics and operations of the ECAL in the CMS experiment at CERN. This involves both experimental and phenomenological studies, covering unexplored analyses within the CMS Heavy Ions group and photon-induced processes. The project also includes participation in detector operations, including ECAL trigger and calibration monitoring during LHC Run III. It is highly interdisciplinary and aims to establish CBPF as a center of excellence in Heavy Ion Physics and ECAL operations in Rio de Janeiro.
